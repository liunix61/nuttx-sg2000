# Apache NuttX RTOS on 64-bit RISC-V Sophgo SG2000 (T-Head C906 / Milk-V Duo S)

64-bit RISC-V Sophgo SG2000 SoC ... Will it boot Apache NuttX RTOS? ðŸ¤” (T-Head C906 / Milk-V Duo S)

Let's find out! Connect our USB UART Dongle like so...

https://milkv.io/docs/duo/getting-started/duos

USB UART Dongle must be CP2102, it doesn't like CH340G ðŸ˜¬

Flip the switch so it's set to "RV" (RISC-V) instead of "Arm"

Milk-V Duo S doesn't ship with U-Boot Bootloader preinstalled. Too bad we can't boot NuttX over TFTP, that will make NuttX Porting a lot easier. Bummer :-(
